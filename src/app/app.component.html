<p>onSelect is being issued twice, when selecting the item and leaving the field.</p>
<p>I'm showing content on console when onSelect event is emitted.</p>
<p-autoComplete
    placeholder="Country"
    #autocompleteField
    [(ngModel)]="selectedCountry"
    [suggestions]="filteredCountries"
    (completeMethod)="filterCountry($event)"
    (onSelect)="onSelect($event)"
    field="name"
    [minLength]="1"
    [forceSelection]="true"
></p-autoComplete>
